# Modern Face Recognition Attendance System using OpenCV

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **contactless attendance management system** that uses an ESP32-CAM module, Raspberry Pi, and OpenCV to detect and recognize faces in real time. Once a face is recognized, the system automatically logs the attendance in a CSV file with a timestamp.

## 🚀 Features
- Contactless face recognition
- Real-time attendance logging
- CSV-based record storage
- Proxy attendance prevention
- Scalable and cost-effective

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Hardware:** ESP32-CAM, Raspberry Pi 3B+, LCD Display
- **Software:** Python, OpenCV, Arduino IDE
- **Libraries:** `opencv-python`, `face_recognition`, `pandas`
